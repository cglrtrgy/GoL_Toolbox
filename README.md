# GoL_Toolbox
a toolbox that calculates the4 binary vector for a given data point and ReLU FFNN, enabling the derivation of the linear model5 for the corresponding polyhedron, extraction of active bits from the binary vector, enumeration6 of neighboring binary vectors, and visualization of the polyhedral decomposition.
